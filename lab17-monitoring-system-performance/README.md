# 🧪 Lab 17: Monitoring System Performance and Resource Usage

## 🎯 Objectives

By the end of this lab, I was able to:

• Monitor CPU usage and load averages  
• Analyze memory utilization  
• Inspect disk usage and I/O activity  
• Monitor active network connections and bandwidth  
• Identify resource-heavy processes  
• Monitor container resource consumption  
• Detect and troubleshoot resource exhaustion  
• Simulate high system load safely
